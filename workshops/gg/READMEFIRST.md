- This workshop has multiple versions. If you use the GitHub Pages link above, you will be presented with a version selection page. If you prefer to browse the workshop using the GitHub repository view, you should choose one of the following files to get started:

  - [README.md](README.md): This version of the workshop assumes you are participating in an Oracle sponsored (and led) workshop that has environments setup and configured in advance.

  - [SS-README.md](SS-README.md): This version of the workshop assumes you wish to work through the workshop with your own account (trial account or customer account), and that you (or someone in your organization) will run the setup steps to prepare the environment.  Note that this will take additional time, and will involve periods of wait while services are provisioned.  Further, lab 100 is slightly different due to setup step differences.
